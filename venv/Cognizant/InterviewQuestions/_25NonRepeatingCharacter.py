# ðŸ§® Problem 25: Find the first non-repeating character in a string
# --------------------------------------------------
# Problem Statement:
# Given a string, find the first character that does not repeat anywhere in the string.
#
# Example:
# Input:  "swiss"
# Output: "w"
#
# Input:  "aabbcc"
# Output: None  # or an indication that no unique character exists
#
# Expected:
# - Implement your own logic to find the first non-repeating character.
# - Consider using dictionaries or arrays to count character frequencies.
# - Aim for an optimal solution with a single pass for counting and another for identifying the first unique character.
